## Forking and cloning MEPP2

In order to become a MEPP2 contributor, you should be at ease with the following usages of [git (version control system)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git)):
 - [git for beginners](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/what-is-version-control) (that refers to a [git install how-to](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) and also provides an interactive tutorial)
 - [Collaborating with git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/syncing) (that mainly introduces the `git remote`, `git fetch`, `git push` and `git pull` commands)
 - Working within a [forking workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), that is the recommended workflow for MEPP2 (as opposed to using e.g. a [centralized workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#centralized-workflow) )

Then you can proceed with
 - [Creating your own github account](https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account/) (if not already done). In doing so, please do choose a login that is unambiguous and straightforward to identify you: this will ease the burden of [IP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intellectual_property) tracking. For example use something like `FirstnameLastname` or `FirstnameLastnameOrganisationname` where the "Organisation Name" is the one you will be using while contributing code to MEPP2.
 For the rest of this inception description we shall assume that you signed in as `YourLogin`.
 - Once signed in, you should [fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the [MEPP2 repository](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) ([Github](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) web interface provides a single button method for this: look in the upper right section of the [MEPP2 repository](https://github.com/MEPP-team/MEPP2) home page)
 - On your desktop machine, you can now [(git) clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone) your fork. When doing so on a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) you could use [something similar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis) to the  following command :
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/YourLogin/MEPP2
  ```
