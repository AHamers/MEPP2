The following headers 
 * `CGAL_boost_graph_properties_PolyMesh_ArrayKernelT.h`
 * `CGAL_boost_graph_traits_PolyMesh_ArrayKernelT.h`

are respective derivative works from version 4.7 of CGAL files
 * `CGAL/boost/graph/properties_PolyMesh_ArrayKernelT.h`
 * `CGAL/boost/graph_traits_PolyMesh_ArrayKernelT.h`

Note that not only were they renamed to avoid any possible collision, but the copies wer e also (tentatively) stripped down from any unecessary inclusion of other CGAL headers.
Refer to `Doc/Devel/Why_partially_copying_some_CGAL_headers.md` for more on this matter.
